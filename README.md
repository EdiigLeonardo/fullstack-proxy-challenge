# Full Stack Proxy Challenge with TailwindCSS
## Project Overview
This is a challenging project designed to showcase your full-stack development skills by creating a proxy for the "CAAT" (Challenge As A Thing) API. The project involves implementing five backend solutions using different technologies (Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET, Express.js, Laravel, Spring Boot) and five frontend solutions using various frameworks (Vue.js, Svelte, Angular, React, Solid). The user interfaces will be styled using Tailwind CSS.

## The main goal of this challenge is to demonstrate your ability to:

- Build a full-stack application by integrating backend and frontend solutions.
- Set up proxies to interact with an external API.
- Utilize different backend technologies and frameworks for the same application.
- Showcase your UI development skills using Tailwind CSS.
- Collaborate on a diverse tech stack and create a cohesive project.
- Challenge Details
### Backend Solutions:
I implement five backend solutions using the following technologies:
- Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
- ASP.NET (C#)
- Express.js (Javascript)
- Laravel (PHP)
- Spring Boot (JAVA)
Each backend solution should include a proxy that interacts with the CAAT API. The backend should handle requests from the front end, perform any necessary transformations, and return the data to the front end.

### Frontend Solutions:
I implement five frontend solutions using the following frameworks:

- Vue.js
- Svelte
- Angular
- React
- Solid
Each frontend solution will interact with the corresponding backend solution through the proxy to fetch and display CAAT API data. You will implement a user interface that showcases the fetched data using Tailwind CSS or SCSS for styling.

## Getting Started
To participate in this challenge:

- Fork this repository.
- Create a new branch for your solution using the format: backend-frontend/your-name.
- Implement the backend solutions and proxies for each technology.
- Implement the frontend solutions for each framework, fetching data through the proxies.
- Style the user interfaces using Tailwind CSS.
- Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
- Create a pull request from your branch to the main repository.
### Submission Guidelines
Your pull request should include:
- Well-documented backend and frontend code.
- Properly configured proxies to interact with the CAAT API.
- Tailwind CSS usage for styling.
- README documentation explaining how to run and test each solution.
- A brief explanation of your technology choices in the README.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of the chosen backend and frontend technologies.
- Familiarity with REST APIs and proxying.
- Understanding of Tailwind CSS for UI styling.
## Technologies Used
#### Backend: Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET, Express.js, Laravel, Spring Boot
