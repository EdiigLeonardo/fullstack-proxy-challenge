# Backend Solutions for Full Stack Proxy Challenge

## Backend Overview

This directory contains the backend solutions implemented as part of the Full Stack Proxy Challenge. The challenge aims to create a proxy for the "CAAT" (Challenge As A Thing) API using different backend technologies, showcasing your ability to work with diverse tech stacks and integrate them seamlessly with frontend solutions.

## Folder Structure

- **ruby-on-rails**: Contains the Ruby on Rails backend solution.
- **asp-net**: Contains the ASP.NET backend solution.
- **express-js**: Contains the Express.js backend solution.
- **laravel**: Contains the Laravel backend solution.
- **spring-boot**: Contains the Spring Boot backend solution.

## Challenge Details

Each backend solution is responsible for:

- Interacting with the CAAT API through a proxy.
- Handling incoming requests from the frontend solutions.
- Transforming data as necessary before sending it to the frontend.
- Implementing the logic required to communicate with the external API.

## Prerequisites

- Proficiency in the respective backend technology (Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET, Express.js, Laravel, Spring Boot).
- Familiarity with RESTful API integration.
- Knowledge of setting up proxy routes.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the specific backend solution directory.
2. Follow the README instructions for setting up and running the backend.
3. Implement proxy routes to interact with the CAAT API.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve or expand the backend solutions are welcome! If you find any issues, want to optimize code, or add features, feel free to create a pull request.
